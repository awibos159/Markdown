<p>A <strong>laptop</strong>, also known as a notebook, is a small, portable personal computer with a &quot;clamshell&quot; form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. Laptops are folded shut for transportation and have a built-in rechargeable battery, making them ideal for mobile use. Unlike desktops, laptops are compact and integrate all the essential computer hardware in a single unit.</p>
